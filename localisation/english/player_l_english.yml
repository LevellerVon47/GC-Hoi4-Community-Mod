 SPN_cult_of_ophitism:0 "The Cult of the Snake"
 SPN_cult_of_ophitism_desc:0 "The Queen has failed. The Parliament has failed. Unionism and more failed. Everyone has failed. There is only Ophitism left. Thus it must be."
 SPN_secure_ciudad_real:0 "Seize Ciudad Real"
 SPN_secure_ciudad_real_desc:0 "Nestled on the plateau, Ciudad Real has all the things we need to operate out of. Rail, radio, and more. And it is also a traditional stronghold for our own faith. It will be the egg from which a new snake shall hatch and grow strong."
 SPN_aztec_weapon_shipments:0 "Weapons from the West"
 SPN_aztec_weapon_shipments_desc:0 "To the West, the Aztec Empire lies as the foremost Ophite state in the world. Wealthy and strong beyond most other powers, it stands as a shining beacon. And always interested in preaching their beliefs. Surely, they have a few weapons to spare for us?"
 SPN_ophite_weaponry:0 "Guns of the Ophites"
 SPN_ophite_weaponry_desc:0 "Ophites have always treasured knowledge and health. And they have also treasured sharing their knowledge, even through persecution up through the ages. We will need the best and the newest to win a confrontation with the Queen and her ilk."
 SPN_secure_internal_support:0 "Win the People"
 SPN_secure_internal_support_desc:0 "No revolution can be complete without thunderous applause from the People as we finish the transformation of everything. We must expand our programmes and reach out to all those left behind. Fact remains. People like to eat food."
 SPN_ophitist_zeal:0 "Win the Nation"
 SPN_ophitist_zeal_desc:0 "There is one step left before we can step into a new and more glorious future. We must attack the bastion of their hubris and burn it to the ground. Only then can we have a society free of those who want to despoil it. Together we can then step into a new dawn."
 SPN_afro_aztec_volunteers:0 "Volunteers from Abroad"
 SPN_afro_aztec_volunteers_desc:0 "They are many, they are manifold. From near and far, but most crucially from Aztec Africa. They have the reputation of fighting as a thousand and they will be crucial in the upcoming confrontation. With trained soldiers and advisors, we will be more powerful than whatever they can come up with."
 SPN_the_kings_parliment:0 "The Queen's Parliament"
 SPN_the_kings_parliment_desc:0 "Whatever the weather, we will only reach prosperity and unity together. We must all come together around the Queen and her Parliament while the stormclouds appear on the horizon."
 SPN_seize_madrid_factories:0 "Seize the Factories of Madrid"
 SPN_seize_madrid_factories_desc:0 "A vital first step must be to seize the factories of Madrid. They could be so much more than they are now, but are lying fallow and empty to the detriment of all. Taking it into the common wealth would really be better for all of us."
 SPN_on_our_own:0 "On Our Own"
 SPN_on_our_own_desc:0 "We cannot risk becomign indebted to the Franks and their machinations.

We will find out how to navigate the road ahead on our own, and without foreign meddling"
 SPN_more_loans:0 "Go Into Yet More Debt"
 SPN_more_loans_desc:0 "Though it once more pains us, there is little cash left, and the only way forward is yet more debt. Though it will add to the already spiralling debt crisis, it is necessary just to keep the lights on and our dues to the public paid."
 SPN_government_bailouts:0 "A Grand Bailout"
 SPN_government_bailouts_desc:0 "And such, we must rescuse those who have been hit by the ongoing problems. Even if we cannot save all of them, we might save the majority and they will form the foundation for when Ibeira will rise from the ashes. But until then, we must ensure that we can survive until tomorrow."
 SPN_aid_from_france:0 "Help from France"
 SPN_aid_from_france_desc:0 "Our friends in France have offered to aid us for the problems ahead. Even if they do not have the capacity, or will to aid us financially, their weapons stores and more are open to us and will help us immensely once the storm hits us.\n\nHopefully."
 SPN_biscay_trail:0 "The Biscay Trail"
 SPN_biscay_trail_desc:0 "Across the Pyrenees, trails used for untold years trace their way from France to Iberia. Many mapped, even more of them unmapped and virtually untraceable. Perhaps our French allies could put this network of paths and trails to use as a clandestine way to send us weapons?"
 SPN_foreign_volunteers:0 "The Foreign Volunteers"
 SPN_foreign_volunteers_desc:0 "There are many who are willing to fight for a good and righteous cause, and no one can doubt that our cause is indeed good and righteous. They arrive on ships, on horse carriages and by foot. A regimented system, one for sorting them into fitting units would be immensely helpful in the future."
 SPN_unify_government:0 "Unite the Parliament"
 SPN_unify_government_desc:0 "We are facing the twin barrels of crushing debt and an impending war. There can be no dissent or any sort of problems internally when the very survial of the state is at stake. Unify Parliament into a cohesive unit, and act as one, or we will die as many!"
 SPN_emergency_conversion:0 "Ploughshares to Swords"
 SPN_emergency_conversion_desc:0 "Future? At present, we are facing a short-term threat that will destroy us and swallow us whole without stopping to chew. No. We must take every precaution just to see this decade through. What good are dreams if we do not survive to carry them out?"
 SPN_SPN_win_war:0 "Into A New Era"
 SPN_SPN_win_war_desc:0 "The War is over. Much blood has been shed in the defence of all that we held dear, but we won. We won the defining question of what Iberia shall be in the future. A future decided not by rabble-rousers but of sensible people."
 SPN_lessons_from_civil_war:0 "Hard-Won Lessons"
 SPN_lessons_from_civil_war_desc:0 "Never again must this repeat itself. Never again must we be forced to shed blood to defend our society. Never again will we be caught without a functional army to ensure said society. Never again will this happen, for Iberia could not afford one war, let alone two."
 SPN_desnekify:0 "Exterminate the Remnants"
 SPN_desnekify_desc:0 "Away from view, remnants and remains of what was once the Ophitists hide from view. The Snakes still remain, still ever the dangerous, just hidden from view. You do not invite a snake into your kitchen for dinner. You cut its head off. This is the same that we must pay onto the Ophitists."
 SPN_iberian_empire:0 "An Iberian Empire"
 SPN_iberian_empire_desc:0 "We must rise above all if we are to find peace. A world where are not standing supreme is a world with dangers. If we do not make sure that no one will be able to challenge us, we will regret it, and we will regret it in lives lost and blood spilled."
 SPN_free_at_last:0 "Free at Last"
 SPN_free_at_last_desc:0 "We are finally free of that national scourge called our formerly crushing debt. No more will the creditors besiege our embassies, nor will be constantly inundated with angry letters asking when they get their money back. We will finally be a nation standing on our two feet"
 SPN_fortify_the_north:0 "The Pyrenees Line"
 SPN_fortify_the_north_desc:0 "The Pyrenees are the first and oldest barrier between us and an continental enemy. We must bolster this and ensure that no one will pass that we do not want to pass. Once we are finished there will be more concrete and steel in the Pyrenees than rock."
 SPN_complete_iberia:0 "Complete the Penninsula"
 SPN_complete_iberia_desc:0 "We cannot be whole if a part of our nation lies beyond our aegis. Parts of the Pyrenees, the natural border of Iberia sits under the yoke of France. A demand is in order. A demand to gain what was lost for our much more enlightened leadership."
 SPN_maximal_concesion:0 "The Sixteen Demands"
 SPN_maximal_concesion_desc:0 "The French are weak and crumbling and we are stronger than ever. They are not just those of old, they are also the relics of a bygone age that should have been thrown to the wolves of all too long ago. But we can still save them, if only they will agree to our demands."
 SPN_monarchist_uprising_in_brazil:0 "Friends in Brazil"
 SPN_monarchist_uprising_in_brazil_desc:0 "Inspired by our heroic struggle, other likeminded people across the seas have taken up our cause and mounted an initiative to take control of Brazil. Certainly, we can support them with all that we can. After all, they might be willing to discuss a deep and comprehensive partnership later."
 SPN_the_empire_of_brazil:0 "A New Empire"
 SPN_the_empire_of_brazil_desc:0 "It is time. Everything is ready for the final stroke. A move to take the entire government in one fell swoop and to clear the way for morning to dawn on Brazil and from there, shine upon Iberia as we all march forthrightly into a new world."
 SPN_the_kingdoms_united:0 "Two Become One"
 SPN_the_kingdoms_united_desc:0 "Two, already united in soul and spirit\n\nTwo already created sisters by Fate\n\nTwo shall become one.\n\nOne greater than their parts."
 SPN_imperial_core:0 "The Metropole"
 SPN_imperial_core_desc:0 "The core of our realm must always come first. Foundries and factories must be expanded and refitted for the coming years. Not just the years of war, but also those of peace so that everything will always run at maximum capacity."
 SPN_military_buildup:0 "Arms for Arms"
 SPN_military_buildup_desc:0 "Toasters and butter is good, but they will do us no good in the age of guns and tanks. We must keep at least some kind and some sort of factories around to produce guns and grenades rather than palm leaves and kitchen appliances. You cannot, after all, fight a war with a toaster."
 SPN_demand_baleares:0 "The Balearic Question"
 SPN_demand_baleares_desc:0 "The Balearics are one of the final pieces of Iberia proper that we do not possess currently. Owned by the French, it has become a drain on their coffers, and with the populace none the happier. Maybe there's an opportunity to be exploited here for our own gain?"
 SPN_zeal_for_new_zealand:0 "Keeping Up with the Kiwis"
 SPN_zeal_for_new_zealand_desc:0 "Far-flung, hard to reach but still the object of our desire lies a number of windswept islands far to the southeast. Long wanted for our nation, despite changing times, we now have the capacity and indeed strenghth to take it, whether the owners want it or not."
 SPN_roman_empire:0 "A Roman Empire"
 SPN_roman_empire_desc:0 "The Queen has entertained thoughts. With the Byzantines falling to Unionism and no other figure emerging, the crown looks tempting. Not just as a crown of a Kingdom. But one of an Empire. And not just any empire.\n\nA Roman Empire"
 SPN_roman_republic:0 "A Roman Republic"
 SPN_roman_republic_desc:0 "The Queen may have failed, but there are inspirations to draw from. A two thousand-four hundred old one in fact. Another people chaed their queen out of the city and created a Republic. That city was Rome. And we shall be its inheritors."
 SPN_provincial_organization:0 "Reorganize the Provinces"
 SPN_provincial_organization_desc:0 ""
 SPN_legacy_of_the_legion:0 "Legacy of the Legions"
 SPN_legacy_of_the_legion_desc:0 "The Legions once marched across Europe, defeating enemies wherever they went. So too shall our new legions. They shall be the prime, the cream of the crop of militaries of the world. For they will be Legion. They will be many."
 SPN_rule_the_waves:0 "Rule the Waves"
 SPN_rule_the_waves_desc:0 "Our world does not just stop at the coast. There are pirates far away, there are threats on the sea from other states far closer. If we are to avoid another war, we must make sure that we can dominate the waterways. And a magnificent fleet looks nice on photographs as well."
 SPN_secure_western_med:0 "Secure the Western Islands"
 SPN_secure_western_med_desc:0 "The Western Islands are an important springboard to look over the Italian Penninsula. From there, one can surveil the entire western coastline and still sit firmly on land without fear of someone walking over and asking one to stop. Securing them should thus be step one."
 SPN_strike_italy:0 "Go After Italy"
 SPN_strike_italy_desc:0 "The Italian Boot stands between us and the Byzantine tumour, and what's more, subscribe to their same kind of thinking. As a necessary step forward, we must take control, both to secure our own security, but also to look further to the east."
 SPN_secure_eastern_med:0 "Secure the East"
 SPN_secure_eastern_med_desc:0 "Two islands lie, together keeping the gate to the Byzantines. The garrison on the island is weak and has yet to figure out the threat that we pose to them. They will have a rude awakening once we land on the islands and take control of them"
 SPN_true_heirs_of_rome:0 "The True Heir of Rome"
 SPN_true_heirs_of_rome_desc:0 "It is time. The Byzantine eagle sleeps in its nest. We will assail the bastion of Unionism, and the false heirs of Rome, and we will burn it to the ground."
 SPN_pirate_radio_island:0 "Radio Iberianopwl"
 SPN_pirate_radio_island_desc:0 "Officially, the big towers being constructed on the island to the east are meant to be the broadcasting towers for a new radio station set up to reach everyone that might want to listen in. Less officially it is also a large radar network for later use."
 SPN_pirate_radio_island_2:0 "Expand the Network"
 SPN_pirate_radio_island_2_desc:0 "It is very thoughtful that we have taken the choice to expand our network. Very strange that the towers oddly enough looks like radar installations and are almost entirely pointed north. Extremely strange."
 SPN_iberian_democracy:0 "Senatorialism Blooms"
 SPN_iberian_democracy_desc:0 "Despite many dangers Iberia has come through, it is clear that at the end of the day, people, both in power and without it believe in a government built from the people, not from a monarch, from a group of snakes or from the archaic Romans."
 SPN_francophilia:0 "Our Friends in France"
 SPN_francophilia_desc:0 "France has always been a friend of ours, and, with our problems solved, "
 SPN_solve_the_debt_crisis:0 "A Mountain of Debt"
 SPN_solve_the_debt_crisis_desc:0 "There is no better way to put this. The debt that we have run up over the last five-hundred years means we are in a pile of deep bodily products. And now this house of cards is threatening to collapse down upon us. Something must be done."
 SPN_out_of_pocket_payments:0 "Find the Money"
 SPN_out_of_pocket_payments_desc:0 "We cannot allow ourselves to become dependent on any foreign bailouts, lest it be used against us in the future to our detriment. We must find the money any way we can, even if we have to take measures we might not like. It is a small price to pay for independence"
 SPN_french_bailouts:0 "The French Connection"
 SPN_french_bailouts_desc:0 "Our French friends and allies have come to us with the offer to bail us out of our crushing debt, or at least stave off the creditors for a couple decades or so. It is always excellent to know that there is another nation in our corner and willing to help us even during our darkest moment."
 SPN_iberian_economic_miracle:0 "The Iberian Miracle"
 SPN_iberian_economic_miracle_desc:0 "From the depth of the abyss we have arisen again as a newly-made economic power. Factories open every day as the clouds clear and the sky seems a little brighter every day, a few more pesetas in everyone's pockets, maybe a little more."
 SPN_industrial_reform:0 "Rationalization of Industry"
 SPN_industrial_reform_desc:0 "Double production, superflous traditions and a wealth of lost knowledge. All of this is just some of the problems that we will have to tackle in order to rise above our problems with the final debt payments. A sweeping gesture, one to fell all those problems in one motion is needed."
 SPN_iberian_universities:0 "Universities of Iberia"
 SPN_iberian_universities_desc:0 "The universities of Iberia have always been famed as hubs of knowledge, even if much of it has been hidden away. No more. They shall be opened, kicking and screaming if necessary to ensure that we can draw upon the whole population for the future."
 SPN_electronics_industry:0 "A Spark and Two Wires"
 SPN_electronics_industry_desc:0 "It cannot as much be called a revolution as an evolution. A paper here, an experiment there. Then another and one more. But the electronic evolution is in full bloom and we are perfectly positioned to take advantage and slot ourselves. If we wanted to."
 SPN_commonwealth_tech:0 "Technological Cooperation"
 SPN_commonwealth_tech_desc:0 "There are many things we can learn from each other. And everyone has things to share and things to teach to others. Together, we can uncover what was once hidden for the betterment of all of us."
 SPN_bob_semple:0 "The Bob Semple"
 SPN_bob_semple_desc:0 "Despite the...lack of will to construct actual tanks and armoured vehicles there are other ideas that can be exploited for our own use. The Bob Semple, based on a far-flung idea from the British can be further developed. Maybe even into a concept of mass-production, for the idea is truly stellar"
 SPN_bureaucratic_army:0 "The Bureau of Bureaucracy"
 SPN_bureaucratic_army_desc:0 "In order to run a nation one cannot just rely on regional deputies. Someone must shuffle the papers, move the wagons and grease the gears. That will be the job of the bureaucratic machines. Those who will work tirelessly to keep everything running, day in and day out."
 SPN_oust_the_king:0 "To Play the Queen"
 SPN_oust_the_king_desc:0 "There is one person who more than anything holds the blame for what went wrong. The Queen. While everything worsened, he sat and played fiddle. While enemies organized, he sat around doing nothing. While Iberia descended into civil war, he stayed completely still. For the good of Iberia, he must go."
 SPN_ties_with_the_uk:0 "Ties with Britain"
 SPN_ties_with_the_uk_desc:0 "Britain has always been a loyal friend of the senatorial kind of government. From the first steps, they have been behind us and our nascent "
 SPN_commonwealth_equipment:0 "British Design"
 SPN_commonwealth_equipment_desc:0 "Britain's factories have produced equipment and upgrades that would not be possible in our factories and their quality and aspects are certainly something we could learn from. Licenses are not cheap, but they are also not too expensive either. And we would be able to learn a lot."
 SPN_barcelona_university_cooperation:0 "The Barcelona Agreement"
 SPN_barcelona_university_cooperation_desc:0 "A number of institutions, from both Britain and Iberianopwl have already created ties to each other.

 SPN_centre_of_learning:0 "A Nexus of Knowledge"
 SPN_centre_of_learning_desc:0 "Barcelona has become a center for knowledge and wisdom. No longer is Iberian just heard in its halls, but French, English and many other languages echo through its corridors and in its great lecture halls. It is truly a symbol of the new Iberia. An Iberia of freedom and knowledge"
 SPN_parlimentary_reform:0 "Accountability Reforms"
 SPN_parlimentary_reform_desc:0 "Every nation must be accountable to the people. And no better accountability than the ability for the government to always be hauled before the representatives and deputies and put to question for their actions or lack thereof. What better indeed."
 SPN_UTI:0 "Bend to the UTI"
 SPN_UTI_desc:0 "The unions form a bedrock for our workers. Their influence too stretches not just to the workplace, but into the homes and even into the halls of power where we reside. Dislike it, and disdain them as we must, we must bend to their demands lest the country collapses."
 SPN_relocate_weapons_depots:0 "'Relocate' Weapons"
 SPN_relocate_weapons_depots_desc:0 "There are so many weapons that occasionally get lost in the scuffle of transit. Not just the small knives, but even rifles might from time to time fall off the truck or train car. And all the while, everyone fails to recognize that they might end up in much more capable hands. Unionite hands that will use them."
 SPN_reorganize_infrastructure:0 "Reorganize Railway Tables"
 SPN_reorganize_infrastructure_desc:0 "The railway network has always been a powerful tool of the high and mighty. It will also be a powerful tool for us. A few reorganizations here and there and we will able to move around unseen, and undetected. And they will all be fooled until it is too late."
 SPN_collectivize_factories:0 "Collectivize Workplaces"
 SPN_collectivize_factories_desc:0 "The factories of the industrialists stand idle, producing only for themselves, rather for the common good, or for the People. The UTI, once it has taken control of them will put put them to much better use than whatever immoral purpose they were using them for."
 SPN_revolutionary_zeal:0 "Ready for Anything!"
 SPN_revolutionary_zeal_desc:0 "The workers stand ready to fight. We have the arms and the people to rise up against the oppressors and their cronies. Once the starting signal sounds, we will be ready to fight the good fight, and we will be right."
 SPN_help_from_byzantium:0 "Look to the East"
 SPN_help_from_byzantium_desc:0 "To the East lies our inspiration, our guiding light, our forerunners.

 SPN_mediterranean_routes:0 "The Mediterranean Express"
 SPN_mediterranean_routes_desc:0 "The armouries of the East have been opened to us, with one small catch of us having to transport the arms ourselves...fortunately, and completely coincidentally, we have come into possession of a number of old transport ships. Strange how things turn out like that."

 SPN_lift_the_burden:0 "Reconstructing and Renewing"
 SPN_lift_the_burden_desc:0 "The War has taken a toll on us all, and the fact of the matter is that our old problems of the crushing debt to our citizens has remained, as that the fact that the country remains pulverized and crushed beneath the burdens of war. Reconstruction must begin promptly."
 SPN_byzantine_bailout:0 "Byzantine Solidarity"
 SPN_byzantine_bailout_desc:0 "With our old debtors...no longer with us, the Byzantines have ended up in possession with quite a lot of the debt. As a sign of their solidarity with us and the Revolution, they could probably be convinced to write it off over a bit of small talk..."
 SPN_public_works:0 "Farms to Factories"
 SPN_public_works_desc:0 "Where there once was fields, the shells and bombs have turned the verdiant green into smoking craters and barren wasteland. No more. They will be turned into the engines of progess, the beacons of industry and of power. A testament to how far we've come since the war."
 SPN_support_miners:0 "Back the Miners"
 SPN_support_miners_desc:0 "With the country slowly returning to normal, the upehaval of the ground and the continued improvements have seen a new proposal.

 SPN_iberia_liberated:0 "Economic Emancipation"
 SPN_iberia_liberated_desc:0 "What was once the crushing yoke upon which we buckled is no more. Every deserving creditor have gotten their due, and every undeserving creditor have been dealt with in their own way. No longer are we shackled to what 500-year old aristocrats decided, nor are we chained to outdated instruments."
 SPN_union_expertise:0 "A Union of Industry"
 SPN_union_expertise_desc:0 "There's a truly breathtaking amount of power, political and industrial in a union. Not just those of the manual workers, but also those of the intellectuals and engineers. Combined, they have shown to be more resourceful than a hundred old systems could ever hope to be."
 SPN_public_tranit:0 "A Backbone of Steel"
 SPN_public_tranit_desc:0 "In the Iberia of today, there is no question. The trains must run on time. With our economy, our people so dependent on the trains, it would be a catastrophe if they could not be relied upon. It must be the foremost job of our railway workers to provide the backbone upon which we all depend."
 SPN_collective_education:0 "Open the Universities"
 SPN_collective_education_desc:0 "What was once the privilege of the few will now be a right enjoyed by the workers and the many.

 SPN_public_technical_education:0 "Technical Education for All"
 SPN_public_technical_education_desc:0 "What is a man if he does not have the knowledge to work? What measure is a man without wisdom? Nothing. If everyone is a worker, then everyone should know the ins and outs of being a worker. Everyone should know how to operate the machines, or how to mill and drill."
 SPN_question_of_government:0 "The Question of Government"
 SPN_question_of_government_desc:0 "The one small problem with running the country is that the question is always how everything should be run on the most basic level. And after a revolution doubly so. A vote must be called. A vote to determine the fundamental political future of Iberia that will outlive and outlast all of us."
 SPN_collective_parlimentarianism:0 "Collective Parliamentarism"
 SPN_collective_parlimentarianism_desc:0 "While the old systems had many flaws, there wer also some good ideas amongst them that were corrupted and coopted for their old and reactionary purposes. Amongs them were the parliament and their system. After all, it is true synthesis to take what works and discard what doesn't."
 SPN_workers_councils:0 "Labour Councils"
 SPN_workers_councils_desc:0 "We must take note that if it was the workers that carried us to our victory, we must start with the unions as the foundation of the government and society as a whole.

 SPN_reform_the_militias:0 "Reform the Militias"
 SPN_reform_the_militias_desc:0 "The old militas have served us well, but it is time that we formalize them into a system that we can understand. Though some may spurn our reliance on them, no one can doubt that they are highly motivated and willing to defend their homes to the last."
 SPN_decolonization:0 "Throw off the Vestigial Colonies"
 SPN_decolonization_desc:0 "What are we if we claim to liberators, but keep lands beyond the view of our mainland oppressed? What are we if we cling to old antiquated posessions claimed by those long-dead with massive losses? Throw them off, and let them determine their future themselves."

 SPN_guns_for_defence_desc:0 "At the end of the day, there is a need for guns to exercise defence. And at the end of the day, guns are a vital part of the Collective Defence.

 SPN_free_the_protectorates:0 "Free the Protectorates"
 SPN_free_the_protectorates_desc:0 "Beyond the Strait of Gibraltar lies the last bastion of the old guard. But we hear those they rule over cry out for liberation and vengeance.

 SPN_force_the_issue:0 "Force the Issue"
 SPN_force_the_issue_desc:0 "It is time to force the issue. The people living there are ready to rise up and the pond of gasoline only needs someone to throw a lit match into it to light it aflame. Surely, the sparks of the muzzle from a gun can provide that spark to set it aflame?"

 SPN_anti_colonial_crusade_desc:0 "It is time. We must take the fight to the hearts of the colonists and liberate the great continent. Only then can they know peace. We might even take it all the way to the bastion of colonialism and burn it to the ground."

 SPN_aviation_effort:0 "To the Skies!"
 SPN_aviation_effort_desc:0 "Planes are not just toys, or tools for reconnaisance. They have become machines of war in their own right. Planes buzzing overhead can cripple initiative, or boost it, not to mention the morale boosters. And that's before we get to their weapons."

 SPN_CAS_effort:0 "Close to the Action"
 SPN_CAS_effort_desc:0 "The Army have cried out for support from the air forces in their planning. More to the point, they want not just the planes buzing overhead, but for the planes to get right into the action and directly helping out our men on the ground."
 SPN_rocket_effort:0 "Rockets and Missiles"
 SPN_rocket_effort_desc:0 "Rockets have proven to be the future. With rockets, the pilot does not even have to take off. All can be done at the press of a button and it will be off. No slow planes that can be shot down, and the rocket will hit the target. Or somewhere near it. Hopefully."
 SPN_NAV_effort:0 "Bombers over the Seas"
 SPN_NAV_effort_desc:0 "Ships are not difficult targets to hit. Much easier than trying to hit targets that move both quicker and smaller. They are especially eaiser if they are laying at anchor in a harbour. Perhaps it would be possible to modify planes for this to happen?"
 SPN_naval_effort:0 "Iberianoplwians on the High Seas"
 SPN_naval_effort_desc:0 "It is from the sea that so much prosperity have arisen. Fish, pearls and it is on the sea lanes that ships laden with so much have come into harbour. To have those in control of other powers would be a catastrophe. Iberianoplw must be in control of them."
 SPN_flexible_navy:0 "A Flexible Navy"
 SPN_flexible_navy_desc:0 "We are starting from behind, and we cannot even pretend that we can immediately jump to contesting the big players. Instead, we must focus on what we can do good, and be able to make life absolutely miserable for those big players if they ever intrude on our waters."
 SPN_large_navy:0 "A Powerful Navy"
 SPN_large_navy_desc:0 "If our navy is to be reckoned with, it cannot just be powerful, but it must also look powerful. Destroyers and submarines might be nice, but they don't have the same 'look' as a mighty battleship has on a postcard."
 SPN_submarine_effort:0 "Beneath the Waves"
 SPN_submarine_effort_desc:0 "The submarines are the new silent killers of the navies of today. They are almost undetectable, lurk in wait, and when they see the opportunity to strike, they send off a line of deadly torpedoes to make short work of ships."
 SPN_cruiser_effort:0 "Starting Small"
 SPN_cruiser_effort_desc:0 "Before we can move to building the large kind of ships, our shipwrights and designers need experience. And while they may not be the big ships that other nations will sail around in, they will still be a tremendous step forward"
 SPN_destroyer_effort:0 "Wasps on the Seas"
 SPN_destroyer_effort_desc:0 "Destroyer are excellent ships. Easy to mass-produce, small and nimble, and carrying armaments to make life difficult for even the largest ship. Easy to destroyed, but so are wasps, and those are still feared for a reason."
 SPN_capital_ships_effort:0 "The Big Ship Project"
 SPN_capital_ships_effort_desc:0 "It is time. Our dockyards are ready to begin the construction of our first ship to go to toe-to-toe with the rest of the world. It will take time, and thousands of tonnes of steel but once it is done it will be truly be a monument to our triumphs"

This has caused a bit of a problem as the 20th Century has dawned and the weightof all of these bad decisions have come home to roost. There has been a slow, but consistent radicalization of factions, influenced by developments in the Byzantines and the Aztecs. And all of this is coming to a head as the new year dawns..."
